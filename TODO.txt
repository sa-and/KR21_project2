We need to implement the following things into "BNReasoner.py"


-d-seperation function, that determines whether something is d-seperated (input x,z,y)

-Ordering: Given a set of variables X in the Bayesian network, compute a good ordering for elimination of X based on the min-degree heuristics (2pts) and the min-fill heuristics (2pts).
(Hint: you get the interaction graph ”for free” from the BayesNet class )

-network pruning: Given a set of query variables Q and evidence E, node- and edge-prune the Bayesian network s.t. queries of the form P (Q|E) can still be correctly calculated

-Marginal Distributions: Given query variables Q and a possibly empty evidence E, compute the marginal distribution P (Q|E) (12pts). 
(Note that Q is a subset of the variables in the Bayesian network X with Q ⊂X but can also be Q = X.)

-MAP and MEP: Given a possibly empty set of query variables Q and an evidence E, compute the most likely instantiations of Q (12pts).

Make sure to also provide some test cases in which you show that your methods work. For that, you
can use the example Bayesian networks which you can find in the ”testing” folder. This includes two
examples from the lecture as well as an extra example. It is not allowed to use already existing packages
for inference on Bayesian networks to accomplish the tasks. Along with the report, you have to submit
you code.
