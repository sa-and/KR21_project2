This project contains methodes to make inferences from Bayesian Networks. It contains the following functions:
network pruning, d-separation, independence, marginalization, maxing-out, factor multiplication, ordering, variable 
elimination, marginal distribution, maximum a-posteriori query (MAP) and most probable explanation (MPE).
Which can be found in the BNReasoner_pruning.py. This the second project of the course Knowledge Representation.

To be able to run BNReasoner_pruning.py, the packages that need to be installed:
- typing 
- pandas 
- copy 
- random

To show that our implementation works, you need to set the corresponding Bool to True in the BNReasoner_pruning.py:
Pruning = False
check_d_separation = False
Independence = False
Marginalization = False
MaxingOut =  False
MultiplyFactor = False
Ordering = False
Variable_Elimination = False
Marginal_distribution = False
Map = False
Mpe = False
